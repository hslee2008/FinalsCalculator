  3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
</h1>
<p>
  In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is

  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to
  explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal
  information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
  personal information: Consent. We may process your information if you have
  given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a
  specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Legal
  Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary

  grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial
  abuse If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
  compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
  collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an
  agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province If disclosure
  is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the
  court relating to the production of records If it was produced by an
  individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the
  collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was
